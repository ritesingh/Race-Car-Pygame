I am inspired to do this after watching sentdex videos on youtube. I thought of taking his simple project to a whole new level.
I was determined for adding acceleration and brake features in this model with multiple cars arriving together and a moving background instead of a simple white space like the one used in the sentdex video.

Finally after taking step by step challenges I did finished this project and its one of its kind. As I have added the car movement function up and down which requires a bit more of algorithm , also the rectangles used in the video of sentdex have been replaced with various cars which are randomly picked. The most challenging part of this project for me was to make multiple cars arrive at the same moment and to make the road move in the background without getting a distorted background. As Pygame does not provide predefined colors
and button icons , It was a bit of a more work to make them in a custom way.
